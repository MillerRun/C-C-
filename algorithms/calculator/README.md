  C written calculator which is able to solve complex math computations (that consists of 2+ operations).
  The main idea is to use recursive method of simplifying the user's string until it finaly converts to the solution.
  For instance:
    2 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 3
    2 + 4 + 3 * 3
    2 + 4 + 9
    6 + 9
    15
